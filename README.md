## About Laravel AXL Toolkit

This repo tracks the blog series from http://thatswhatised.com on building full-stack web applications with Laravel and Cisco UCM AXL API.

## Episodes

Episode 1: [SQL Interface](http://thatswhatised.com/blog/post/laravel-and-the-cisco-ucm-axl-api-part-1)
* In this epidode we'll spend a lot of time building out the base Laravel application and integration with Cisco CUM via AXL API.  By the end we'll have a solid framework with UCM integration that we can build on in future episodes.

Episode 2: [Cucm Model](http://thatswhatised.com/blog/post/laravel-and-the-cisco-ucm-axl-api-part-2)
* In this epidode we'll create a Cucm model, database table, model factory and seeder.  By the end we'll have a well-structured back end code base to build the front end CRUD operations on, which will happen in episode 3.
