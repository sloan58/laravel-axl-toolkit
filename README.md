## About Laravel AXL Toolkit

This repo tracks the blog series from http://thatswhatised.com on building full-stack web applications with Laravel and Cisco UCM AXL API.

## Episodes

Episode 1: [SQL Interface](http://thatswhatised.com/blog/post/laravel-and-the-cisco-ucm-axl-api-part-1)
* In this epidode we'll spend a lot of time building out the base Laravel application and integration with Cisco CUM via AXL API.  By the end we'll have a solid framework with UCM integration that we can build on in future episodes.

Episode 2: [Cucm Model](http://thatswhatised.com/blog/post/laravel-and-the-cisco-ucm-axl-api-part-2)
* In this epidode we'll create a Cucm model, database table, model factory and seeder.  By the end we'll have a well-structured back end code base to build the front end CRUD operations on, which will happen in episode 3.

Episode 3: [Cucm CRUD (Index Page)](http://thatswhatised.com/blog/post/laravel-and-the-cisco-ucm-axl-api-part-3)
* In this epidode we'll create a Cucm model index view to display a listing of all our Cucm models.  We'll make some updates to our CucmController, routes files and blade templates.  Instead of tackling all the CRUD views in one post, I'll split them out into smaller sections, starting with the index view here.
